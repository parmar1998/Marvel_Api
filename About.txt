** Project Functionalities **

LocalStorage - 	localStorage is meant for storing relatively small amounts of data that are required by your web application 
				to provide a better user experience. If you need to store larger amounts of data or data that should be synchronized 
				across devices or sessions, you might consider using other storage mechanisms, such as server databases 
				or cloud storage solutions.
